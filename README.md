## Ideas :

For debuging web pages in another PC

You are developing webpages running in Mobile Browser or Mobile App WebView 

You want to know what happend in that webpages

Now you can inject script into your webpage , 

And in PC browser , you can do these :

1 - Check how many webpages are requesting 'RemoteDevTools' 

2 - Select one webpage and start debug , and keep it auto reconnect after it refreshed.

3 - Intercept console.log/info/warn/error , XMLHttpRequest , every API the browser JS allow to intercept

4 - Show DOM elements tree , check the attributes , style , and modify 

5 - Manage JavaScript objects , window/document/cookie/localStorage/sessionStorage/...

6 - send JavaScript to eval in target webpage , get the result
